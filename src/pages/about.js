                    I love learning new things. <br />
                I grew up in Japan and I was a pre-med student before I came to the US.
                I learned C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS since I came here and I am currently learning React.
                <br />I enjoy programming since it empowers me to build my ideas.

                <br />

                I also enjoy designing. <br />
                I believe in the power of minimalism. Making a good
                elaborate design is difficult but making it simple
                is much more difficult. <br />
                Since the day I learned that I fell in love with the process.
                {/* And I really enjoy what I am doing :) */}
