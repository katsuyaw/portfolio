                    I love learning new things. <br />
                        I was born and raised in Japan and I spent 4 years as a pre-med student before I came to the US.
I wrote my first program in 2020 and so far I have learned C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS and I am learning ReactJS.

                <br /><br />

                I enjoy designing. <br />
                I have done multiple creative projects.
                I believe in the power of minimalism. Making a good
                elaborate design is difficult but making it simple
                is much more difficult. <br />
                Since the day I learned that I fell in love with the process.
                {/* And I really enjoy what I am doing :) */}
